Spico: I wish to climb Mount Nwiiwii.  The Blood Myth legend says that curses are removed from any who reach the top.
Spirits: You are Drakom.  Born with afflicted blood.  It is who you are.  Accept it.
Spico: I am more than you tell me who I am, Spirits.  I am one of the Dragon Tribe, but I don't accept the curse.  Let me pass so I can free myself!
Spirits: You will never be a Drakuures.  Your affliction is permanent.  Passed down from your ancestors to you, as you might pass it down to your children and their children's children.
Spico: Are you saying the Blood Myth is a lie?
Spirits: No.  It is not a lie.  But neither is it truth.  Mount Nwiiwii is dangerous.  No place for an unprepared Drakom.
Spico: Spirits, why care whether I try my luck or not?  This is MY life, MY decision.  I'm tired of everyone telling me what I can and can't do!
